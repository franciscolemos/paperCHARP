An aircraft rotation consists in assigning flights to aircraft in such a way that operational constraints, such as, maintenance, flight continuity, turn-round time and airport capacity, are satisfied. Aircraft rotations are often subject to disruption. The Aircraft Recovery Problem (ARP) consists in altering the planned flight schedule to compensate the disruptions that resulted in the temporary or permanent unavailability of aircraft.

In this work, we propose a recovery procedure for each disrupted rotation that starts by finding the first infeasible flight. We split the rotation in two parts, the first one which is feasible and second one which is infeasible.  For the infeasible part of the aircraft rotation, the algorithm finds if the flights can be cancelled or delayed during a given time window. The algorithm returns the flight domains and by calculating the cartesian product of these domains we derive the search space for the infeasible part of the rotation.  

Depending on the size of the search space, the algorithm uses the upper heuristic to find solutions above a certain size of the search space or the lower heuristic to find solutions below a certain size of the search space. For each iteration over the aircraft rotation the algorithm will perform a pincer movement by simultaneously decreasing the upper bound and increasing the lower bound, thus closing in on a feasible solution. During the recovery procedure we introduce new flights in the infeasible part of the rotation. If we find discontinuity when attempting to reconnect the recovered part of the rotation with the first part of the rotation, the algorithm also adds taxi flights. 

We present results for the solution cost and computing time for the Constructive Heuristic for the Aircraft Recovery Problem (CHARP) for various time windows and the introduction of new flights and taxi flights.
