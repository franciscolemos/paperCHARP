The start (respectively, the end) of the recovery
time window is denoted $ RTW_s $ (respectively, $ RTW_e $). The recovery time window is divided
into smaller time windows equal to one hour, denoted $ h \subseteq RTW $.\\ 

The information regarding the starting and ending of the $RTW$ is set in the first line of the $config.csv$ file $e.g.$:\\

%In this paper we consider three types of disruptions: flight, aircraft and airport disruptions. Flight disruptions refer to flight delays or cancellations. Aircraft disruptions consist of time periods where an aircraft is unavailable, which is mainly caused by mechanical failures or industrial action. Airport disruptions refer to airport closures usually incurred by severe weather conditions. When these disruptions happen, the flights assigned to the disrupted aircraft cannot be operated.
