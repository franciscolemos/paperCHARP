\section{Computational Results}\label{sec:compResults}

In this section, we aim at studying the cost and the computing time of the CHARP for the overall 32 data instances of the ROADEF 2009 Challenge.  To obtain the computing time, we run all 32 instances simultaneously and we retrieve the computing time of the last one being solved. As for the cost we use the cost checker application provided by the ROADEF 2009 Challenge. The remainder of this section consists of, Section \ref{sec:impact} where we will demonstrate the impact of adding new flights and taxi flights. Since the heuristic performs a pincer movement in Section \ref{sec:pincerSpeed} we will determine which is the best speed by changing the decremental and incremental steps.\\
 
%All the models and algorithms were written in Python language. The scripts were implemented on a computer with 4-core processors running at 2.3  GHz and 16 GB memory.\\
